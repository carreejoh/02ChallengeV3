## Moriseon Company Website
	Moriseon is a company which sells SEO and ways to improve websites and their ranking.

## Description 
	This was a mock up website designed for students to fix. It's still a static site with no functionality quite yet, but makes use of css and html.
	All photos are locally linked (don't use an external link.) The site is designed to be viewed and used to learn about ways to improve SEO for a website. 

## Installation 
	None is required, it's a website.

## Credits 
	The site itself was originally created by the bootcamp team, and I was only required to improve SEO.

## License 
	N/A

## For The Teachers
	My lack of commits is due to me creating a new repo, which finally fixed the issue of the website not deploying correctly.
	All deployments ended up with either the photo links or css link not working at all, and moving everything over to a new repo seemed to work.
